     // Add Commands here:
    // e.g. AddSequential(new Command1());
    //      AddSequential(new Command2());
    // these will run in order.

    // To run multiple commands at the same time,
    // use AddParallel()
    // e.g. AddParallel(new Command1());
    //      AddSequential(new Command2());
    // Command1 and Command2 will run in parallel.

    // A command group will require all of the subsystems that each member
    // would require.
    // e.g. if Command1 requires chassis, and Command2 requires arm,
    // a CommandGroup containing them would require both the chassis and the
    // arm.

	AddSequential(new WaitCommand(5));
